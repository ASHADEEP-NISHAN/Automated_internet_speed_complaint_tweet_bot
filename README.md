# Automated_internet_speed_complaint_tweet_bot
An Automated Internet Speed Complaint Tweet Bot, developed using Python and web automation tools, is designed to help you address slow internet speeds effectively. This bot runs periodic internet speed tests through a web browser to monitor your connection. If the detected speed falls below the threshold prescribed by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the bot automatically logs into your Twitter (X) account and posts a complaint tweet. The tweet includes details of the slow speed and mentions your ISP to publicly address the issue. This automation ensures you consistently hold your ISP accountable for maintaining the promised service quality without manual intervention.
